# Faang_PM_Data
Information about PM Role at FAANG in San Francisco, Bay Area 

1. I used a CSV file available online that tracks STEM Salaries across the united states for a comprehensive view. 
2. From there I narrowed down the locality to San Francisco, Bay Area since I live near to it and zeroed down on Product Managaer role that I love. 
3. I used PANDAS library of python to plot the graph through Jupyter notebooks to connect to the data source.
