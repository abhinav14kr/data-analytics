# Personal-Expense-Report
Information about personal expenses 

1. The data was from the excel sheet that I use to log every expenditure with a set of columns 
2. The project is personal as the data is about my spending habits and the data is not open source or public as it is usually with initial data related projects for aspirants 
3. I used the PANDAS Python library through Jupyter Notebook to import the CSV file and plot the graphs
4. As simple as the data is to plot graphs within the Excel or spreadsheet that I use, there are lots of possibilities to plot with different conditions, which was made easy with PANDAS
5. I was able to identify the pattern across verticals
